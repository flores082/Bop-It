        When you start the application, you can see the menu screen, which will allow us to travel through the screens,
        it has an exit button from the game, a presentation button where you can get to know me, a preferences button
        if you want to change something in the application, one that would show the scores on the screen and also
        the highest. Finally, also a button to Play the game. Words will come out and you have to do what they tell you.
        press, shake, etc.... you will have points for each correct one and if you make a mistake once the game is over or if
        you run out of time the juice will end, you will have the option to save your score at the end.
